      description: "World's history"
      1: 'I still have this old college book of mine, "The World in the 21st Century". Let me give you a quote: "Despite the technological breakthrough, by the middle of the 21st century, it became clear that the planet‚Äôs resources are exhausted and climate change is irreversible.\n\nSimply put, governments were too busy with their national economic issues. They overlooked one important detail. If you have no planet to live on, you have no economics. Neither global nor national. And that`s it. As expected, they were gravely concerned. Still, their concerns had not fixed anything. The chance to save the planet was gone.'
      2: 'Under the threat of extinction, global leaders had gathered their wits surprisingly quickly.  They even had developed a strategy. No, no one was going to Mars. Humanity established a new ambitious project‚Äìmoving to Virtuality.'
      3: 'The technologies for consciousness digitization were almost ready. We only had to figure out how to decompose and digitize bodies. And voila. Finally, people have learned how to create their perfect digital copies. The only thing, the physical body had to be destroyed on the way. Still, isn`t it a fair price to get to a brave new world?\n‚ÄúOlav, son, we signed up for digitization...‚Äù I`ve heard this phrase when I was 15.\nI still remember how it was, to live in the material world.\nBut you don`t. The first digital generation.'
      4: 'You have nothing to compare with, so just trust me. We got rid of a shitload of trouble. In Virtuality, there are no wars, no diseases, no violence, no aging, no environmental disasters. On top of that, we don`t even the truly shitty weather. Only some weather changes for the purpose of diversifying your sensations.'
      5: 'And still, in Virtuality there are people, albeit digital ones. And where there are people, there is ambition. Envy. Cheating. Pain. Loneliness. We digitized all our vices. All flaws and weaknesses, that torment a human being from the cradle to the grave. Wait a second, you have no idea what a grave is, huh? Got it. Nevermind. Just look around. Or look inside yourself, you also feel pretty unsettled, don`t you? Is that why you`re here?'
      6: 'I am certain that, the current rise of hacking has grown out of exactly these roots. Of course, hackers are the smartest, the most talented youngsters. But none of you went to work for a corporation. Because you were looking for something else. None of the hackers of the First Generation works for L-Ri laboratories, develops for Murum or does PR for Future Sight. I`ll tell you about them, just a little bit later.'
